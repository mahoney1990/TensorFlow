Text analysis programs using TensorFlow

In the tolstoy.py file we form word associations from the novel "War and Peace" using the n-skip alogirithm. To run this script, you will need the file 'tolstoy.txt' and the auxilary script 'ns_fuction.py' which conducts negative sampling. 
The output of this script can be visualized via PCA at https://projector.tensorflow.org/. Simply upload the output file 'metadata.tsv' to generate a three dimensional representation of word assocaiations.

The other scripts in this repository are TensorFlow tutorials and include scripts to build, calibrate, and tune deep neural nets.
